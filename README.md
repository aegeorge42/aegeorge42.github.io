# Neural Networks from Scratch
Playable at [aegeorge42.github.io](https://aegeorge42.github.io/)

The goal of this project was to create an interactive guide to neural networks for beginners. It's covered under a Creative Commons Zero license, so feel free to share or use wherever! (if this made its way into a classroom, I'd be so thrilled) 

I had to learn about neural networks in tandem with making this project. Here's the resources that were most helpful for me:

- [3Blue1Brown's video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Michael Nielson)](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
- [Google Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)
- [Matt Mazur's backpropogation example](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/)
- [The Evolution of Trust (Nicky Case)](https://ncase.me/trust/)
- [Pretty much every article at towardsdatascience.com with the keyword "neural network"](https://towardsdatascience.com/search?q=neural%20network)
